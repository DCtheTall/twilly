# TODO

## 1. User Story Mapping

What should people who consume this module be able to do?

Why would I choose to develop using this instead of a site w a GUI?

## 2. General architecture of library, what will be responsible for what?

User story map should help get my thoughts organized for this. I know I
will need to experiment with SMS cookies so that's a start.
